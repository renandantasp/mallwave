In this Unity game, I endeavored to create an immersive shopping experience in a shopping city called Mall City, with a dynamic shopkeeper interaction system, allowing players to buy and sell clothes. The game also features equipable clothes, adding an extra layer of customization to the player's avatar. However, due to time constraints, certain aspects of the code structure, especially the Shopkeeper system, may not be as optimized as desired.

The game's shopkeeper interaction is designed to provide players the possibility to buy and sell items. Upon entering the shop, players can interact with the shopkeeper using the E button. The shopkeeper provides information about available clothes, their prices and your current money.

The core mechanic of the game revolves around the buying and selling of clothes. Players can browse through a variety of garments, each with its own unique attributes and prices. To purchase an item, players simply click on it, and then click on buy. Selling clothes follows a similar process, allowing players to manage their inventory and make strategic decisions based on their preferences and budget.

Adding a layer of personalization, the game features clothes that are equipable. Once purchased, players can equip their avatars with the acquired garments, changing their in-game appearance.

Despite the successful implementation of key features, certain challenges arose during development. The Shopkeeper system, while designed with the MVC model for separate responsibilities, may not have achieved the desired level of abstraction. Due to time constraints, features menu coordination, a better SFX system and a more detailed city were not added. Comprehensive testing and refining of the code structure were also limited.

In summary, Mallwave offers players an immersive shopping experience with a focus on shopkeeper interaction, buying and selling mechanics, and equipable garments. Despite the time limitations impacting code optimization, the game achieves his main purposes.

The controls are:

- Movement : Arrow keys or wasd
- Open and Close inventory: I key
- Interacting with shopkeeper: E key
- Close the Shopkeeper store: Q key
- Pause the game: Escape Key
